# Project3Cplusplus
College course project 

# What Problem was it solving?
Integrated Python and C++. C++ user interface and Python functions manipulating data.
Created a frequency dict of grocery items and the number of times purchased in a day.
Printed the number of sales per day of a user specified item.

# What did I do well?
I utilized python well to read the file and create the freq dict. That part felt good, I also wrote a good user interface that validated input and did wht it needed to do.

# Where could I enhance my code?
I may have forgotten certain input validation, but I also wasn't able to test how the program really worked because I was dealing with a LNK1104 error that wasn't allowing me to run the program.

# Where did I struggle?
I struggled in passing parameters to the Python functions but the C++ functions that were provided actually served that role and I simply forgot that was the case.

# What skills will be transferable?
Feeling comfortable using two languages at once was really empowering. I was very imtimidated at first and then I started relaxing and figureing it out bit by bit. 

# How did I make this program readable and maintainable?
Firstly, I made a lot of comments about what everything was doing and it really helped me so i imagine it owuld help anyone else looking at it in the future, which would only be me!! Lol.
